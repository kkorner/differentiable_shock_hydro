  abstract = {With recent advances in both responsive materials and fabrication
              techniques, it is now possible to construct integrated functional
              structures, composed of both structural and active materials. We
              investigate the robust design of such structures through topology
              optimization. By applying a typical interpolation scheme and
              filtering technique, we prove existence of an optimal design to a
              class of objective functions which depend on the compliances of the
              stimulated and unstimulated states. In particular, we consider the
              actuation work and the blocking load as objectives, both of which
              may be written in terms of compliances. We study numerical results
              for the design of a 2D rectangular lifting actuator for both of
              these objectives, and discuss some intuition behind the features of
              the converged designs. We formulate the optimal design of these
              integrated responsive structures with the introduction of voids or
              holes in the domain, and show that our existence result holds in
              this setting. We again consider the design of the 2D lifting
              actuator now with voids. Finally, we investigate the optimal design
              of an integrated 3D torsional actuator for maximum blocking torque.

              impact creates challenges when designing for impact resistance.
              While simple geometries of layered material are conventional,
              advances in 3D printing and additive manufacturing techniques have
              now made tailored geometries or integrated multi-material
              structures achievable. Here, we apply gradient-based topology
              optimization to the design of such structures. We start by
              constructing a variational model of an elastic--plastic material
              enriched with gradient phase-field damage, and present a novel
              method to efficiently compute its transient dynamic time evolution.
              We consider a finite element discretization with explicit updates
              for the displacements. The damage field is solved through an
              augmented Lagrangian formulation, splitting the operator coupling
              between the nonlinearity and non-locality. Sensitivities over this
              trajectory are computed through the adjoint method, and we develop
              a numerical method to solve the resulting adjoint dynamical system.
              We demonstrate this formulation by studying the optimal design of
              2D solid--void structures undergoing blast loading. Then, we
              explore the trade-offs between strength and toughness in the design
              of a spall-resistant structure composed of two materials of
              differing properties undergoing dynamic impact.},

              the core of high-energy density (HED) multiphysics simulations as
              shocks are the driving force in experiments like inertial
              confinement fusion (ICF). In this work, we describe our extension
              of the hyperviscosity technique, originally developed for shock
              treatment in finite difference simulations, for use in arbitrarily
              high-order finite element methods for Lagrangian hydrodynamics.
              Hyperviscosity enables shock capturing while preserving the
              high-order properties of the underlying discretization away from
              the shock region. Specifically, we compute a high-order term based
              on a product of the mesh length scale to a high power scaled by a
              hyper-Laplacian operator applied to a scalar field. We then form
              the total artificial viscosity by taking a non-linear blend of this

              The method builds on and extends our previous work in the

              perspective that enables subzonal physics and material modeling [V.
              A. Dobrev et al., Internat. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 82 (2016),
              pp. 689--706]. Curvilinear mesh relaxation is based on node
              movement, which is determined through the solution of an elliptic
              equation. The remap phase is posed in terms of advecting state
              variables between two meshes over a fictitious time interval. The
              resulting advection equation is solved by a discontinuous Galerkin
              (DG) formulation, combined with a customized Flux Corrected
              Transport (FCT) type algorithm. Because conservative fields are
              remapped, additional synchronization steps are introduced to
              preserve bounds with respect to primal fields. These steps include
              modification of the low-order FCT solutions, definition of
              conservative FCT fluxes based on primal field bounds, and monotone
              transitions between primal and conservative fields. This paper
              describes the mathematical formulation and properties of our
              approach and reports a number of numerical results from its
              implementation in the BLAST code [BLAST: High-order finite element

              known for more than 150 years, the enormous increase in penetrating
              power that can be produced by lining the explosive cavity with thin
              metal has been discovered only recently. During the war a number of
              light, low velocity, antitank weapons (e.g., the rocket-propelled
              Bazooka) were developed which made use of this phenomenon to
              perforate thick armor plate.A fairly complete mathematical theory

              of the experimental data that aided in the formulation and testing
              of the theory. The process is separated into two phases: first, the
              formation of part of the metal liner into a long thin jet traveling
              longitudinally at very high velocities (30,000 ft./sec.) and,
              second, the forcing aside of the target material by the extremely
              high pressures (0.3-million atmos.) produced by the impact of the
              high speed jet.The theories of both of these phases are based upon
              the classical hydrodynamics of perfect fluids, which is applicable
              because the strength of the metals involved can be neglected at the

              parameter scans. This, combined with the complex and
              computationally expensive nature of plasma edge codes, makes these
              procedures extremely cumbersome. Gradient-based optimization
              methods can significantly reduce this effort, but require an
              efficient strategy for sensitivity calculation. Algorithmic
              Differentiation (AD) offers an efficient and accurate solution,
              allowing semi-automatic sensitivity computation in complex,
              continuously developed codes. The adjoint AD mode is especially
              attractive, as its cost is independent of the number of input
              parameters. In this paper, adjoint AD sensitivity calculation is
              deployed for the first time in plasma edge codes, applying the
              TAPENADE AD tool to SOLPS-ITER. Adjoint AD results are verified to
              be machine precision accurate compared to tangent AD mode, and up
              to 10-9 compared to finite differences. Scalings of AD
              computational efforts prove the advantages of adjoint compared to
              tangent AD, while memory requirements rapidly increase for adjoint,
              showing the need for an improved checkpointing strategy. With the
              new tool, a wealth of information becomes accessible to the
              modeler. An adjoint sensitivity analysis for a COMPASS density scan
              identifies the input parameters with largest impact on the solution

  abstract = {At the heart of deep learning we aim to use neural networks as
              function approximators - training them to produce outputs from
              inputs in emulation of a ground truth function or data creation
              process. In many cases we only have access to input-output pairs
              from the ground truth, however it is becoming more common to have
              access to derivatives of the target output with respect to the
              input - for example when the ground truth function is itself a
              neural network such as in network compression or distillation.
              Generally these target derivatives are not computed, or are
              ignored. This paper introduces Sobolev Training for neural networks
              , which is a method for incorporating these target derivatives in
              addition the to target values while training. By optimising neural
              networks to not only approximate the function's outputs but also
              the function's derivatives we encode additional information about
              the target function within the parameters of the neural network.
              Thereby we can improve the quality of our predictors, as well as
              the data-efficiency and generalization capabilities of our learned
              function approximation. We provide theoretical justifications for
              such an approach as well as examples of empirical evidence on three
              distinct domains: regression on classical optimisation datasets,
              distilling policies of an agent playing Atari, and on large-scale
              applications of synthetic gradients. In all three domains the use
              of Sobolev Training, employing target derivatives in addition to
              target values, results in models with higher accuracy and stronger
              generalisation.},

  abstract = {The numerical approximation of the Euler equations of gas dynamics
              in a movingLagrangian frame is at the heart of many multiphysics
              simulation algorithms. Here, we present a general framework for
              high-order Lagrangian discretization of these compressible shock
              hydrodynamics equations using curvilinear finite elements. This
              method is an extension of the approach outlined in [Dobrev et al.,
              Internat. J. Numer. Methods Fluids, 65 (2010), pp. 1295--1310] and
              can be formulated for any finite dimensional approximation of the
              kinematic and thermodynamic fields, including generic finite
              elements on two- and three-dimensional meshes with triangular,
              quadrilateral, tetrahedral, or hexahedral zones. We discretize the
              kinematic variables of position and velocity using a continuous
              high-order basis function expansion of arbitrary polynomial degree
              which is obtained via a corresponding high-order parametric mapping
              from a standard reference element. This enables the use of
              curvilinear zone geometry, higher-order approximations for fields
              within a zone, and a pointwise definition of mass conservation
              which we refer to as strong mass conservation. Moreover, we
              discretize the internal energy using a piecewise discontinuous
              high-order basis function expansion which is also of arbitrary
              polynomial degree. This facilitates multimaterial hydrodynamics by
              treating material properties, such as equations of state and
              constitutive models, as piecewise discontinuous functions which
              vary within a zone. To satisfy the Rankine--Hugoniot jump
              conditions at a shock boundary and generate the appropriate entropy
              , we introduce a general tensor artificial viscosity which takes
              advantage of the high-order kinematic and thermodynamic information
              available in each zone. Finally, we apply a generic high-order time
              discretization process to the semidiscrete equations to develop the
              fully discrete numerical algorithm. Our method can be viewed as the
              high-order generalization of the so-called staggered-grid
              hydrodynamics (SGH) approach and we show that under specific
              low-order assumptions, we exactly recover the classical SGH method.
              We also present numerical results from an extensive series of
              verification tests that demonstrate several important practical
              advantages of using high-order finite elements in this context.},

              algorithm that avoids the random walk behavior and sensitivity to
              correlated parameters that plague many MCMC methods by taking a
              series of steps informed by first-order gradient information. These
              features allow it to converge to high-dimensional target
              distributions much more quickly than simpler methods such as random
              walk Metropolis or Gibbs sampling. However, HMC's performance is
              highly sensitive to two user-specified parameters: a step size {$
              \varepsilon$} and a desired number of steps L. In particular, if L
              is too small then the algorithm exhibits undesirable random walk
              behavior, while if L is too large the algorithm wastes computation.
              We introduce the No-U-Turn Sampler (NUTS), an extension to HMC that
              eliminates the need to set a number of steps L. NUTS uses a
              recursive algorithm to build a set of likely candidate points that
              spans a wide swath of the target distribution, stopping
              automatically when it starts to double back and retrace its steps.
              Empirically, NUTS performs at least as efficiently as (and
              sometimes more effciently than) a well tuned standard HMC method,
              without requiring user intervention or costly tuning runs. We also
              derive a method for adapting the step size parameter {$\varepsilon$
              } on the fly based on primal-dual averaging. NUTS can thus be used
              with no hand-tuning at all, making it suitable for applications

              efficient "turnkey" samplers.},

  abstract = {We present an artificial viscosity scheme tailored to
              finite-deformation Lagrangian calculations of shocks in materials
              with or without strength on unstructured tetrahedral meshes of
              arbitrary order. The artificial viscous stresses are deviatoric and
              satisfy material-frame indifference exactly. We have assessed the
              performance of the method on selected tests, including: a
              two-dimensional shock tube problem on an ideal gas; a
              two-dimensional piston problem on tantalum without strength; and a
              three-dimensional plate impact problem on tantalum with strength.
              In all cases, the artificial viscosity scheme returns stable and
              ostensibly oscillation-free solutions on meshes which greatly
              underresolve the actual shock thickness. The scheme typically
              spreads the shock over 4 to 6 elements and captures accurately the
              shock velocities and jump conditions.},

  abstract = {Mixing between two adjacent fluids has important consequences for
              inertial fusion capsule implosions and for supernova explosions.
              Consider an interface with small, random perturbations between two
              fluids of densities {$\rho$}A and {$\rho$}B. When a shock passes
              through the interface, those perturbations grow and the two fluids
              begin mixing in a process called Richtmyer--Meshkov (RM) mix, in
              analogy with Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) mix generated when the system
              undergoes a constant acceleration. Around the interface a
              time-dependent mixing width h evolves from the initial value h0 and
              grows very large for strong shocks. If the interface sees a second
              shock, also called a reshock, the mixing is again intensified. In
              this paper we examine four RM experiments on shock-generated
              turbulent mix and find them to be in good agreement with our
              earlier simple model in which the growth rate {\.h} of the mixing
              layer following a shock or reshock is constant and given by 2{$
              \alpha$}A{$\Delta$}v. Here A is the Atwood number ({$\rho$}B-{$\rho
              $}A)/({$\rho$}B+{$\rho$}A), {$\Delta$}v is the jump in velocity
              induced by the shock or reshock, and {$\alpha$} is the constant
              measured in RT experiments: {$\alpha$}bubble{$\approx$}0.05-0.07, {
              $\alpha$}spike{$\approx$}(1.8-2.5){$\alpha$}bubble for A{$\approx$}
              0.7-1.0. We then extend the model to t{$>$}t{$\ast$} or,
              equivalently, h{$>$}h{$\ast$} when the growth rate begins to decay
              and exhibit h{$\sim$}t{\texttheta} behavior. We ascribe this
              changeover to loss of memory of the direction of the shock or
              reshock, signaling the transition from highly directional to
              isotropic turbulence. In the simplest extension of the model, h{$
              \ast$}/h0 is independent of {$\Delta$}v and depends only on A: h{$
              \ast$}/h0{$\approx$}2.5-3.5 for A{$\approx$}0.7-1.0.},

              presents Enzyme, a high-performance automatic differentiation (AD)

              synthesizing gradients of statically analyzable programs expressed
              in the LLVM intermediate representation (IR). Enzyme synthesizes

              targets LLVM IR including C, C++, Fortran, Julia, Rust, Swift, MLIR
              , etc., thereby providing native AD capabilities in these

              a machine-learning focused benchmark suite including Microsoft's
              ADBench, AD on optimized IR achieves a geometric mean speedup of
              4.2 times over AD on IR before optimization allowing Enzyme to
              achieve state-of-the-art performance. Packaging Enzyme for PyTorch

  abstract = {Computing derivatives is key to many algorithms in scientific
              computing and machine learning such as optimization, uncertainty
              quantification, and stability analysis. Enzyme is a LLVM compiler
              plugin that performs reverse-mode automatic differentiation (AD)
              and thus generates high performance gradients of programs in
              languages including C/C++, Fortran, Julia, and Rust. Prior to this
              work, Enzyme and other AD tools were not capable of generating
              gradients of GPU kernels. Our paper presents a combination of novel
              techniques that make Enzyme the first fully automatic reversemode
              AD tool to generate gradients of GPU kernels. Since unlike other
              tools Enzyme performs automatic differentiation within a
              general-purpose compiler, we are able to introduce several novel
              GPU and AD-specific optimizations. To show the generality and
              efficiency of our approach, we compute gradients of five GPU-based
              HPC applications, executed on NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. All benchmarks
              run within an order of magnitude of the original program's
              execution time. Without GPU and AD-specific optimizations,
              gradients of GPU kernels either fail to run from a lack of
              resources or have infeasible overhead. Finally, we demonstrate that
              increasing the problem size by either increasing the number of
              threads or increasing the work per thread, does not substantially
              impact the overhead from differentiation.},

  abstract = {Estimating the model parameters from measured data generally
              consists of minimizing an error functional. A classic technique to
              solve a minimization problem is to successively determine the
              minimum of a series of linearized problems. This formulation
              requires the Fr{\'e}chet derivatives (the Jacobian matrix), which
              can be expensive to compute. If the minimization is viewed as a
              non-linear optimization problem, only the gradient of the error
              functional is needed. This gradient can be computed without the Fr{
              \'e}chet derivatives. In the 1970s, the adjoint-state method was
              developed to efficiently compute the gradient. It is now a
              well-known method in the numerical community for computing the
              gradient of a functional with respect to the model parameters when
              this functional depends on those model parameters through state
              variables, which are solutions of the forward problem. However,
              this method is less well understood in the geophysical community.
              The goal of this paper is to review the adjoint-state method. The
              idea is to define some adjoint-state variables that are solutions
              of a linear system. The adjoint-state variables are independent of
              the model parameter perturbations and in a way gather the
              perturbations with respect to the state variables. The
              adjoint-state method is efficient because only one extra linear
              system needs to be solved.Several applications are presented. When
              applied to the computation of the derivatives of the ray
              trajectories, the link with the propagator of the perturbed ray
              equation is established.},

              conditions using the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence
              Livermore National Laboratory. We can reach pressures in the
              100-TPa regime on the Hugoniot, or {$\sim$}500-GPa regime along a
              quasi-isentrope, allowing the sample under study to remain solid,
              at planetary interior pressures. We observe RT stabilization (i) at
              an ablation front; (ii) in the presence of a strongly radiative
              shock; and (iii) in a unique regime of quasi-isentropic, high
              pressure, solid-state material flow, where the material strength
              significantly affects the evolution of a hydrodynamically unstable
              interface. The Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) instability occurs at an
              interface between two fluids of differing density during an
              acceleration. These instabilities can occur in very diverse
              settings, from inertial confinement fusion (ICF) implosions over
              spatial scales of {$\sim$}10-3-10-1 cm (10--1,000 {$\mu$}m) to
              supernova explosions at spatial scales of {$\sim$}1012 cm and
              larger. We describe experiments and techniques for reducing
              (``stabilizing'') RT growth in high-energy density (HED) settings
              on the National Ignition Facility (NIF) at Lawrence Livermore
              National Laboratory. Three unique regimes of stabilization are
              described: (i) at an ablation front, (ii) behind a radiative shock,
              and (iii) due to material strength. For comparison, we also show
              results from nonstabilized ``classical'' RT instability evolution
              in HED regimes on the NIF. Examples from experiments on the NIF in
              each regime are given. These phenomena also occur in several

  abstract = {The Richtmyer--Meshkov instability (RMI) is a phenomenon that
              occurs at the interface of two substances of different densities
              due to an impulsive acceleration, such as a shock wave passing
              through this interface. Under these conditions, the instability can
              be seen as interface perturbations begin to grow into narrow jets
              or spikes of one substance that propagate into the other. In some
              cases, this interface may involve an elastic--plastic material,
              which can play a significant role in the development and behavior
              of the RMI. The ability to effectively control RMI jetting and
              spike growth is one major limiting factor in technological
              challenges, such as inertial confinement fusion, that involve using
              high-pressure shock waves to implode a fuel target. The propagation
              of RMI growth can lead to increased asymmetry in this implosion
              process and significantly reduce the obtained energy yield. We use
              hydrodynamics simulations of impactor shock-compression experiments
              and methods based in design optimization to suppress RMI spike
              growth by altering the geometry and other properties of a
              shock-compressed elastic--plastic material target that shares an
              interface with atmospheric air. These hydrodynamics simulations use
              an arbitrary Lagrangian--Eulerian method with a high-order finite
              element approach. Our results demonstrate that RMI suppression can
              be achieved by intentionally creating a separate upstream interface
              instability to counteract the growth of long narrow RMI spikes at
              an interface with initial perturbations.},

              creating a deep linear incision. The general design of a shaped
              charge involves detonating a confined mass of high explosive (HE)
              with a metal-lined concave cavity on one side to produce a high
              velocity jet for the purpose of striking and penetrating a given
              material target. This jetting effect occurs due to the interaction
              of the detonation wave with the cavity geometry, which produces an
              unstable fluid phenomenon known as the Richtmyer--Meshkov
              instability and results in the rapid growth of a long narrow jet.
              We apply machine learning and optimization methods to hydrodynamics
              simulations of linear shaped charges to improve the simulated jet
              characteristics. The designs that we propose and investigate in
              this work generally involve modifying the behavior of the
              detonation waves prior to interaction with the liner material.
              These designs include the placement of multiple detonators and the
              use of metal inclusions within the HE. We are able to produce a
              linear shaped-charge design with a higher penetration depth than

  abstract = {The ability to control the behavior of fluid instabilities at
              material interfaces, such as the shock-driven Richtmyer--Meshkov
              instability, is a grand technological challenge with a broad number
              of applications ranging from inertial confinement fusion
              experiments to explosively driven shaped charges. In this work, we
              use a linear-geometry shaped charge as a means of studying methods
              for controlling material jetting that results from the
              Richtmyer--Meshkov instability. A shaped charge produces a
              high-velocity jet by focusing the energy from the detonation of
              high explosives. The interaction of the resulting detonation wave
              with a hollowed cavity lined with a thin metal layer produces the
              unstable jetting effect. By modifying the characteristics of the
              detonation wave prior to striking the lined cavity, the kinetic
              energy of the jet can be enhanced or reduced. Modifying the
              geometry of the liner material can also be used to alter jetting
              properties. We apply optimization methods to investigate several
              design parameterizations for both enhancing or suppressing the
              shaped-charge jet. This is accomplished using 2D and 3D
              hydrodynamic simulations to investigate the design space that we
              consider. We also apply new additive manufacturing methods for
              producing the shaped-charge assemblies, which allow for the
              experimental testing of complicated design geometries obtained
              through computational optimization. We present a direct comparison

              an amount of memory, the calculation of the adjoint code is split
              and is done part by part from restart points called checkpoints.
              Griewank proposed a checkpointing method named Revolve, which
              provides an optimal logarithmic behavior with respect to time and
              memory requirement. In this work, some checkpointing schedules are
              proposed. Some of them correspond to special cases of Revolve.The
              user's preference is essential to choose between time and memory
              requirements. This is a key point for adjoint codes of temporal
              models such as the meteorological model Meso-NH that may be used
              for weather forecasts. When the computational time is the top
              priority, a particular checkpointing scheme allows computation of
              the adjoint code with at most one extra integration of the model.
              The memory requirement behaves then as the square root of the
              number of iterations of the model. Checkpointing schemes are tested
              on adjoint simulations of Meso-NH.},

              a central component in preventive and corrective control

              play an important role in a wide range of engineering, geophysical,
              and astrophysical flows. They represent a triggering event that, in
              many cases, leads to large-scale turbulent mixing. Much effort has
              been expended over the past 140 years, beginning with the seminal
              work of Lord Rayleigh, to predict the evolution of the
              instabilities and of the instability-induced mixing layers. The
              objective of Part I of this review is to provide the basic
              properties of the flow, turbulence, and mixing induced by RT, RM,
              and Kelvin--Helmholtz (KH) instabilities. Historical efforts to
              study these instabilities are briefly reviewed, and the
              significance of these instabilities is discussed for a variety of
              flows, particularly for astrophysical flows and for the case of
              inertial confinement fusion. Early experimental efforts are
              described, and analytical attempts to model the linear, and
              nonlinear regimes of these mixing layers are examined. These
              analytical efforts include models for both single-mode and
              multi-mode initial conditions, as well as multi-scale models to
              describe the evolution. Comparisons of these models and theories to
              experimental and simulation studies are then presented. Next,
              attention is paid to the issue of the influence of stabilizing
              mechanisms (e.g., viscosity, surface tension, and diffuse
              interface) on the evolution of these instabilities, as well as the
              limitations and successes of numerical methods. Efforts to study
              these instabilities and mixing layers using group-theoretic ideas,
              as well as more formal notions of turbulence cascade processes
              during the later stages of the induced mixing layers, are
              inspected. A key element of the review is the discussion of the
              late-time self-similar scaling for the RT and RM growth factors, {$
              \alpha$} and {\texttheta}. These parameters are influenced by the
              initial conditions and much of the observed variation can be
              explained by this. In some cases, these instabilities induced flows
              can transition to turbulence. Both the spatial and temporal
              criteria to achieve the transition to turbulence have been
              examined. Finally, a description of the energy-containing scales in
              the mixing layers, including energy ``injection'' and cascade
              processes are presented in greater detail. Part II of this review
              is designed to provide a much broader and in-depth understanding of
              this critical area of research (Zhou, 2017. Physics Reports,

  abstract = {Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) and Richtmyer--Meshkov(RM) instabilities are
              well-known pathways towards turbulent mixing layers, in many cases
              characterized by significant mass and species exchange across the
              mixing layers (Zhou, 2017. Physics Reports, 720--722, 1--136).
              Mathematically, the pathway to turbulent mixing requires that the
              initial interface be multimodal, to permit cross-mode coupling
              leading to turbulence. Practically speaking, it is difficult to
              experimentally produce a non-multi-mode initial interface. Numerous
              methods and approaches have been developed to describe the late,
              multimodal, turbulent stages of RT and RM mixing layers. This paper
              first presents the initial condition dependence of RT mixing layers
              , and introduces parameters that are used to evaluate the level of
              ``mixedness'' and ``mixed mass'' within the layers, as well as the
              dependence on density differences, as well as the characteristic
              anisotropy of this acceleration-driven flow, emphasizing some of
              the key differences between the two-dimensional and
              three-dimensional RT mixing layers. Next, the RM mixing layers are
              discussed, and differences with the RT mixing layer are elucidated,
              including the RM mixing layers dependence on the Mach number of the
              initiating shock. Another key feature of the RM induced flows is
              its response to a reshock event, as frequently seen in shock-tube
              experiments as well as inertial confinement events. A number of
              approaches to modeling the evolution of these mixing layers are
              then described, in order of increasing complexity. These include
              simple buoyancy--drag models, Reynolds-averaged Navier--Stokes
              models of increased complexity, including K--{$\varepsilon$}, K--L,
              and K--L--a models, up to full Reynolds-stress models with more
              than one length-scale. Multifield models and multiphase models have
              also been implemented. Additional complexities to these flows are
              examined as well as modifications to the models to understand the
              effects of these complexities. These complexities include the
              presence of magnetic fields, compressibility, rotation,
              stratification and additional instabilities. The complications
              induced by the presence of converging geometries are also
              considered. Finally, the unique problems of astrophysical and
              high-energy-density applications, and efforts to model these are
              discussed.},

  abstract = {In diverse areas of science and technology, including inertial
              confinement fusion (ICF), astrophysics, geophysics, and engineering
              processes, turbulent mixing induced by hydrodynamic instabilities
              is of scientific interest as well as practical significance.
              Because of the fundamental roles they often play in ICF and other
              applications, three classes of hydrodynamic instability-induced
              turbulent flows---those arising from the Rayleigh-Taylor,
              Richtmyer-Meshkov, and Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities---have
              attracted much attention. ICF implosions, supernova explosions, and
              other applications illustrate that these phases of instability
              growth do not occur in isolation, but instead are connected so that
              growth in one phase feeds through to initiate growth in a later
              phase. Essentially, a description of these flows must encompass
              both the temporal and spatial evolution of the flows from their
              inception. Hydrodynamic instability will usually start from
              potentially infinitesimal spatial perturbations, will eventually
              transition to a turbulent flow, and then will reach a final state
              of a true multiscale problem. Indeed, this change in the spatial
              scales can be vast, with hydrodynamic instability evolving from
              just a few microns to thousands of kilometers in geophysical or
              astrophysical problems. These instabilities will evolve through
              different stages before transitioning to turbulence, experiencing
              linear, weakly, and highly nonlinear states. The challenges
              confronted by researchers are enormous. The inherent difficulties
              include characterizing the initial conditions of such flows and
              accurately predicting the transitional flows. Of course, fully
              developed turbulence, a focus of many studies because of its major
              impact on the mixing process, is a notoriously difficult problem in
              its own right. In this pedagogical review, we will survey
              challenges and progress, and also discuss outstanding issues and
              future directions.},

  abstract = {Hydrodynamic instabilities such as Rayleigh--Taylor (RT) and
              Richtmyer--Meshkov (RM) instabilities usually appear in conjunction
              with the Kelvin--Helmholtz (KH) instability and are found in many
              natural phenomena and engineering applications. They frequently
              result in turbulent mixing, which has a major impact on the overall
              flow development and other effective material properties. This can
              either be a desired outcome, an unwelcome side effect, or just an
              unavoidable consequence, but must in all cases be characterized in
              any model. The RT instability occurs at an interface between
              different fluids, when the light fluid is accelerated into the
              heavy. The RM instability may be considered a special case of the
              RT instability, when the acceleration provided is impulsive in
              nature such as that resulting from a shock wave. In this
              pedagogical review, we provide an extensive survey of the
              applications and examples where such instabilities play a central
              role. First, fundamental aspects of the instabilities are reviewed
              including the underlying flow physics at different stages of
              development, followed by an overview of analytical models
              describing the linear, nonlinear and fully turbulent stages. RT and
              RM instabilities pose special challenges to numerical modeling, due
              to the requirement that the sharp interface separating the fluids
              be captured with fidelity. These challenges are discussed at length
              here, followed by a summary of the significant progress in recent
              years in addressing them. Examples of the pivotal roles played by
              the instabilities in applications are given in the context of solar
              prominences, ionospheric flows in space, supernovae, inertial
              fusion and pulsed-power experiments, pulsed detonation engines and
              Scramjets. Progress in our understanding of special cases of RT/RM
              instabilities is reviewed, including the effects of material
              strength, chemical reactions, magnetic fields, as well as the roles
              the instabilities play in ejecta formation and transport, and
              explosively expanding flows. The article is addressed to a broad
              audience, but with particular attention to graduate students and
              researchers who are interested in the state-of-the-art in our

              optimization of the two-dimensional LS-89 turbine cascade. The
              objective is to minimize the entropy generation at subsonic and
              transonic flow conditions while maintaining the same flow turning.
              Nineteen design variables are used to parametrize the geometry. The
              optimization problem is used to compare two major classes of
              optimization algorithms and at the same time deduce if this problem
              has multiple local solutions or one global optimum. A first
              optimization strategy uses a gradient-based Sequential Quadratic
              Programming (SQP) algorithm. This SQP algorithm allows to directly
              handle the non-linear constraints during the optimization process.
              An adjoint solver is used for computing the sensitivities of the
              flow quantities with respect to the design variables, such that the
              additional gradient computational cost is nearly independent of the
              number of design variables. In addition, the same optimization
              problem is performed with a gradient-free-metamodel
              assisted-evolutionary algorithm. A comparison of the two
              Pareto-fronts obtained with both methods shows that the
              gradient-based approach allows to find the same optimum at a
              reduced computational cost. Moreover, the results suggest that the
              considered optimization problem is uni-modal. In other terms, it is
              characterized by a single optimal solution.},

  abstract = { The study of the sensitivity of the solution of a system of
              differential equations with respect to changes in the initial
              conditions leads to the introduction of an adjoint system, whose
              discretization is related to reverse accumulation in automatic
              differentiation. Similar adjoint systems arise in optimal control
              and other areas, including classical mechanics. Adjoint systems are
              introduced in such a way that they exactly preserve a relevant
              quadratic invariant (more precisely, an inner product). Symplectic
              Runge--Kutta and partitioned Runge--Kutta methods are defined
              through the exact conservation of a differential geometric
              structure, but may be characterized by the fact that they preserve
              exactly quadratic invariants of the system being integrated.
              Therefore, the symplecticness (or lack of symplecticness) of a
              Runge--Kutta or partitioned Runge--Kutta integrator should be
              relevant to understanding its performance when applied to the
              computation of sensitivities, to optimal control problems, and in
              other applications requiring the use of adjoint systems. This paper
              examines the links between symplectic integration and those
              applications and presents in a new, unified way a number of results
              currently scattered among or implicit in the literature. In
              particular, we show how some common procedures, such as the direct
              method in optimal control theory and the computation of
              sensitivities via reverse accumulation, imply, probably unbeknownst
              to the user, “hidden” integrations with symplectic partitioned
              Runge--Kutta schemes. },

  abstract = {To ensure manufacturability and mesh independence in density-based
              topology optimization schemes, it is imperative to use restriction
              methods. This paper introduces a new class of morphology-based
              restriction schemes that work as density filters; that is, the
              physical stiffness of an element is based on a function of the
              design variables of the neighboring elements. The new filters have
              the advantage that they eliminate grey scale transitions between
              solid and void regions. Using different test examples, it is shown
              that the schemes, in general, provide black and white designs with
              minimum length-scale constraints on either or both minimum hole
              sizes and minimum structural feature sizes. The new schemes are
              compared with methods and modified methods found in the literature.

  abstract = {A density-based topology optimization approach is proposed to
              design structures with strict minimum length scale. The idea is
              based on using a filtering-threshold topology optimization scheme
              and computationally cheap geometric constraints. The constraints
              are defined over the underlying structural geometry represented by
              the filtered and physical fields. Satisfying the constraints leads
              to a design that possesses user-specified minimum length scale.
              Conventional topology optimization problems can be augmented with
              the proposed constraints to achieve minimum length scale on the
              final design. No additional finite element analysis is required for
              the constrained optimization. Several benchmark examples are
              presented to show the effectiveness of this approach.},
